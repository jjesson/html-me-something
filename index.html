                    The Early Days (1900-1945)
                </h2>
                <p>The early days of golf were somewhat akin to the wild west days in the US. The game was mainly played in Scotland, with only elites being able to afford the equipment and time associated with the game. 
                    People were shut out from the game and equipment was reserved to hickory shafts, often breaking due to poor quality control.
                    The courses were often  unkempt and forced players to not make mistakes, or they would be severely punished for mistakes. The long grass, wave-like fairways, and natural greens also contributed to the difficulty.

                    <p class = "secondary">Bobby Jones ruled this era of golf, with the way his equipment and skill revolutionized the game. He is probably best known for his putter, "Calamity Jane". His ability to hit fairways and read the green in this manner simply lead him to dominate the field, 
                    and lead into a life after professional golf. While Bobby Jones may have been an excellent amateur and professional golfer, His legacy will be remembered eternally for something else; establishing Augusta National.

                    The Transitional Period (1945-1980)

                        <p>
                    The transitional period in golf could honestly be considered golf's "Golden era". So many of the players we stil love to tlak about played during this era: Lee Trevino, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Sam Snead, Gary Player. The list goes on and on.
                    This may have been due to the transition away from hickory shafts into steel ones, as well as the standardization of golf equipment. Training methods also helped out these players become much better, because there was more than 50 years of golf which had already been played, and the minds of golf could help peple imporve their game much faster.
                    In addition to this, the courses and players were now available to the masses. More quality players were allowed to enter the field, and raise the level of competition

                            Jack Nicklaus is the king of this era, but many people have mixed emotions about the player himself. Nicklaus was very stoic and came from a relatively well-off background, so the common man tended to gravitate towards Arnold Palmer, another extremely fine golfer. 
                            There is no doubting the abilities of Nicklaus, because he has the trophy cabinet to back it up. The most majors of all time in one of the most stacked eras and a presence after the game makes him one of if not the greatest golder of all time

                    Theres really no quesiton about it, Tiger Woods is the master of golf. His story is full of ups and downs, the single greatest golfer making television shows at the age of 2. 
                    Tiger Woods ran through the competion for over a decade, and he is still picking up wins regularly when he plays. Although his career is riddled with injuries, marital strife, and other "not-so-perfect" moments, he is by far and away still the greatest golfer who has ever lived.
